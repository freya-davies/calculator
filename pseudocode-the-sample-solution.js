// HTML

// create a class with ids of: title, tagline, answer. 

// class row has 19 buttons sectioned into 5 rows to look like a basic calculator. 
// rows go like this with the first one being the top:
// AE, CE, % and รท
// 7, 8, 9, x
// 4, 5, 6, -
// 1, 2, 3, + (+ is shared over 2 rows)
// 0, . =




// CSS

// calculator should be 250px wide, 335px heigh with no margins.

// curve the edges of the calculator
// and give it a grey shadow using box-shadow

// The title should be centered with 10px of padding top and bottom

// the tagline should be in caps and font .7em and open

// the number input should have a height of 40px, width of 80%
// Should have 1px solid border, 2em font. 
// needs padding around the font (R: 10px, B: 20px)
// needs inset shaddow around strings 


// buttons display in block with a width of 40px, height of 30px and border of 1px solid
// AC and CE are red the other buttons are grey
// all button text is white
// curve the buttons' border radius all sides to 80%10px
// Add 5px margin to left and right and 8px to the bottom
// add box shadow which is light around the outside and then fades back to dark towards the center (more on top side than bottom)
// Same shadow outside but but dark and it fades out more to the top of the box. 
// make an outline boarder to stop the fading from spreading too much by using  &:focus {outline: 0;}
// when the buttons are clicked (active) make the background of the button change to have more of the fading colour come up from the bottom of the button.

// make the + button span 2 rows high (65px) 




// JS

// make an array called entries

// make a variable called total which = 0

// make a variable called equation which = a string
// I dont understand the next part but I think it does this:

//make the buttons work by creating a function that uses if/else statement to determin whether the entry is the following and push it to the equation accordingly:
// * adds the button value to the disply if it is a number or a dot
// * clears the total (AC)
// * clears last entry (CE)
// * push the symbol (+, - etc) to the equation
// * make the symbols equal what they actually do (eg x is *)
// when = is clicked return "=" + equationTotal on display
